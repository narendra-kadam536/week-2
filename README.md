Making Decisions &amp; Repeating Tasks in Python

# Grade Calculator Program 

This Python program calculates the **total marks, percentage, and grade**
for a student based on marks entered by the user.

## Project Structure

- grade_calculator.py → Main Python program
- test_cases.txt → Sample test cases and expected output
- screenshots → Program output screenshots
- README.md → Project documentation

##  How to Run the Program

1. Ensure Python is installed:
   bash
   python --version

## If–Else Statements
Description:
If–else statements allow a program to make decisions. The program checks a condition and executes one block of code if the condition is true, otherwise it executes another block.

## Comparison Operators
Description:
Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return either True or False depending on the comparison result.
## For Loops
Description:
A for loop is used to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times. It is commonly used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
## While Loops
Description:
A while loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains true. The loop stops when the condition becomes false.
## Functions
Description:
Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They help reduce repetition and make programs easier to understand and maintain.
## Basic Error Handling
Description:
Error handling is used to handle runtime errors and prevent the program from crashing. It allows the program to continue running even if an error occurs.
